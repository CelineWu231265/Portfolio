# Analytics Translator – Research for Digiwerkplaats MKB West-Brabant

## Overview
This project was completed during **Year 2, Block A** of the **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** program at **Breda University of Applied Sciences**.  
The focus of the block was to develop the professional role of an **Analytics Translator** — a specialist who bridges the gap between **technical data science teams** and **business stakeholders**, ensuring that data-driven insights are effectively translated into actionable strategies.

In collaboration with **Digiwerkplaats MKB West-Brabant**, our team conducted a **mixed-method research project** to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their digital transformation journey.  
The research provided insights into how consumers and employees perceive, adopt, and respond to AI-related technologies and digital innovations.

## Research Context
SMEs are increasingly adopting digital technologies such as chatbots, AI-based tools, and data-driven marketing systems. However, their success depends on factors like customer acceptance, employee knowledge, and perceived data privacy.  
The project addressed questions such as:
- How do consumers perceive AI-driven technologies like chatbots in customer service?  
- What are consumers’ expectations regarding cybersecurity and privacy?  
- How do customers assess the reliability of online business information?  
- What is the current level of AI knowledge among SME employees?

- **Qualitative Research:**  
  Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted to capture in-depth perspectives, providing context and nuance to the survey findings.

- **Stakeholder Analysis:**  
  A stakeholder analysis identified and mapped key actors within the SME ecosystem, assessing their interests, influence, and data-related concerns.

- **Policy Development:**  
  Research findings were translated into actionable recommendations for SMEs through a **policy paper**, summarized and presented during a final **academic conference**.
