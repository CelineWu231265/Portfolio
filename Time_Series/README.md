# Time Series Forecasting and Data Analytics for ANWB

## Overview
This project was completed during **Year 1, Block D** of the **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** program at **Breda University of Applied Sciences**.  
In collaboration with **ANWB (Royal Dutch Touring Club)**, the project explored how data science can be applied to mobility data for smarter, safer, and more sustainable transportation in the Netherlands.

The goal was to analyze and forecast trends in **traffic, mobility behavior, and environmental impact**, using **machine learning** and **time series forecasting** techniques to deliver data-driven insights for ANWB’s operational and strategic decision-making.

## Objectives
- Analyze real or simulated **mobility and traffic data** from ANWB.  
- Build and evaluate **time series forecasting** and **regression models**.  
- Visualize and interpret temporal patterns and seasonality in transportation data.  
- Use **SQL** and **Python** to process, query, and analyze large datasets.  
- Translate analytical findings into actionable insights for ANWB stakeholders.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Cleaned and merged mobility-related datasets provided by ANWB.  
   - Handled missing values, time irregularities, and feature scaling.  
   - Queried structured data using **SQL** for filtering and aggregation.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Identified **seasonal trends**, **traffic peaks**, and **regional variations**.  
   - Created visualizations to illustrate patterns in **vehicle usage**, **travel times**, and **incident frequency**.  

3. **Modeling & Forecasting:**  
   - Implemented predictive models such as **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **Random Forest Regressors**.  
   - Compared models using **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **MAPE** to assess accuracy.  
   - Performed **feature engineering** to improve model performance.  

4. **Visualization & Reporting:**  
   - Built clear, interactive visualizations summarizing trends and forecasts.  
   - Delivered findings through a **presentation and technical report** aimed at non-technical stakeholders.

## Key Features
- Developed **time series forecasting models** to predict mobility patterns.  
- Conducted **correlation and trend analysis** to understand travel behavior.  
- Applied **SQL** for data extraction and transformation.  
- Presented insights using clear and accessible **visual reports**.  

---

## Results
- Uncovered key insights into **traffic seasonality and behavioral patterns**.  
- Built forecasting models capable of predicting future traffic volume and related metrics.  
- Delivered recommendations to support **data-driven decision-making** for ANWB.  
- Strengthened practical skills in **data cleaning, modeling, and visualization**.
