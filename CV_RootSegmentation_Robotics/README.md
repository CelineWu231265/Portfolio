# Root Segmentation and Robotics Simulation

## Overview
This project was completed during **Year 2, Block B**, focusing on **Computer Vision and Robotics** for The Netherlands Plant Phenotyping Centre(NPEC).
It combined **image segmentation** and **robotics simulation** to address agricultural automation challenges.

The goal was to develop a **U-Net segmentation pipeline** for plant root analysis and a **digital twin simulation** of a robotic arm using PyBullet.

## Objectives
- Build and train a **U-Net model** for plant root segmentation.  
- Perform morphological filtering and skeletonization for root length estimation.  
- Simulate the **OT-2 liquid handling robot** in PyBullet.  
- Create a **Gym-compatible environment** for reinforcement learning control.
