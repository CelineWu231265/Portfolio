# MLOps Pipeline for Model Deployment

## Overview
This project was completed during **Year 2, Block D**, focusing on **MLOps and deployment** of machine learning models.  
The goal was to understand and implement the full **CI/CD lifecycle** for data-driven applications using **Azure DevOps** and **GitHub Actions**.

---

## Objectives
- Develop an **automated ML pipeline** integrating data processing, training, and deployment.  
- Apply **GitFlow branching** and **version control best practices**.  
- Use **Docker** for reproducibility and **MLflow** for model tracking.  
- Deploy models through **Azure DevOps** and monitor performance.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python, YAML  
- **Libraries:** scikit-learn, MLflow, Docker, Azure SDK  
- **Tools:** Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Visual Studio Code  

---

## Key Features
- End-to-end CI/CD pipeline for ML model deployment  
- Automated testing, linting, and container builds  
- Model tracking and experiment management with MLflow  
- Integration with Azure for scalable cloud deployment

---

## Results
- Successfully built and deployed models through a continuous integration pipeline.  
- Improved understanding of **production-ready AI systems** and **DevOps automation**.  
- Strengthened collaboration and code management using version control workflows.

---

## Reflections
This project helped me connect software engineering principles with data science workflows.  
It strengthened my interest in **AI deployment**, **scalable infrastructure**, and **MLOps automation**.
