"00:00:27,530","00:00:31,170","And today, guys, welcome to the communist utopia of Poland.",happiness
"00:00:31,250","00:00:38,450","We are currently in the city of Krakow, which is very well known for its old architecture, medieval castles, old churches, and so on.",happiness
"00:00:38,530","00:00:44,850","However, Krakow actually has a different side that not many people are aware of, and that is the district of Nova Huta.",neutral
"00:00:45,009","00:00:54,210",This area was built here in the 1950s under the Polish Communist government to be located next to the steelworks plants that actually used to have the name of Vladimir Lenin.,neutral
"00:00:54,320","00:00:57,520",And there's actually a particular reason why I was very excited to visit this place.,happiness
"00:00:57,520","00:01:06,319","You see, guys, obviously if you follow my channel, you might know that I come from Russia, and I'm actually originally from the city of Chelyabinsk, which is one of Russia's main sort of industrial cities.",neutral
"00:01:06,319","00:01:12,640","We have a lot of factories, and in my city we do actually have neighborhoods similar to this built around steelworks plants.",neutral
"00:01:12,640","00:01:19,760","And actually this neighborhood of Novokhuta is usually compared a lot to Magnita Gorsk, which is another city located in the Chelyabinsk oblast where I originally come from.",neutral
"00:01:19,760","00:01:26,540","And actually, even if you take a look at pictures of how the layout looks from up above this area in Magnita Gorsk, it looks eerily similar.",surprise
"00:01:26,859","00:01:33,659","We're actually here right now in the very center of Nova Huta on the main square, which actually, ironically enough, now bears the name of Ronald Reagan.",happiness
"00:01:33,659","00:01:42,420","Not very communist, but nevertheless, today I think it's going to be very exciting to walk around this communist, sort of Stalinist style, working class neighborhood of Krakow.",happiness
"00:01:42,420","00:01:47,099",And I'd like to take a look at it and see if it's any similar to what we have back in Russia.,neutral
"00:01:47,099","00:01:51,099",And let's see what Poland has done with their communist past and how it looks like today.,neutral

"00:01:53,409","00:01:59,250","All right, guys, so here we are walking here through the one of the main streets actually here, which is known as the Alley of Roses.",neutral
"00:01:59,250","00:02:05,569","And as you can clearly tell here by the architecture, you know, it's a very different vibe from central Krakow with its old European style.",happiness
"00:02:08,050","00:02:08,650","Yes, yes.",neutral
"00:02:08,650","00:02:17,090","There's going to be a lot of parallels to draw with Chelyabinsk because, like, there's literally a neighborhood on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk of our hometown that looks pretty much almost exactly like this.",neutral
"00:02:17,250","00:02:20,530",Although this is probably a little bit cleaner and there's probably a little bit more greenery.,happiness
"00:02:20,770","00:02:21,449",Exactly.,neutral
"00:02:21,449","00:02:21,669",But.,anger
"00:02:21,740","00:02:28,580","But one thing I'm aware of is that Supposedly on this alley right here, back in the day, obviously when this neighborhood was built, they used to have a Vladimir Lenin statue.",surprise
"00:02:28,580","00:02:32,539","And supposedly it was probably somewhere around here, but let's walk and see exactly where that was.",neutral
"00:02:36,060","00:02:41,419","So originally when this neighborhood was built here, this was a time where, so to say, communist Poland was just beginning.",neutral
"00:02:41,419","00:02:43,219",This was shortly after the Second World War.,neutral
"00:02:43,219","00:02:49,340",And the idea behind this neighborhood actually here was to build something that would counter the center of the city of Krakow.,neutral
"00:02:49,340","00:02:54,439","Because Krakow has always been a city that's been associated with kind of the intelligentsia, the upper class and so on.",neutral
"00:02:54,439","00:02:58,280","And obviously when you're trying to build a communist state, you need to create a bit of an alternative.",surprise
"00:02:58,280","00:03:10,680","So the idea behind this neighborhood was actually to create a bit of a, again, communist planned utopia built around the steelworks factory that would attract poor people and working class people, people from villages to come here and essentially settle and work at the factory.",neutral
"00:03:10,680","00:03:14,319","And this is exactly how, you know, back in the Soviet Union as well, this is how things works.",neutral
"00:03:14,319","00:03:19,879",They would literally build entire cities inside neighborhoods around a certain factory or a plant that's just been opened.,neutral
"00:03:20,069","00:03:22,870",And Nova Huta is Poland's biggest neighborhood that's like this.,neutral
"00:03:23,030","00:03:26,789",And actually the steelworks plan that this neighborhood was built around still works to this day.,happiness
"00:03:26,789","00:03:30,750","Obviously it's no longer called Vladimir Lenin, but things haven't changed too much.",sadness
"00:03:30,750","00:03:33,909",A lot of the people who still live here actually still work at the factory.,neutral
"00:03:34,310","00:03:39,509",And I just did a bit of googling and I guess it turns out that the Vladimir Lenin statue actually used to be somewhere right here.,surprise
"00:03:39,509","00:03:42,069",I'm gonna put a historical picture here for you guys to witness.,happiness
"00:03:42,069","00:03:55,770","But yeah, right next to this communist looking fonts and everything, this caviar or an old food place right across from here you used to have the Lenin statue, which now is obviously gone because Poland has gone through a process of decommunization which Russia hasn't.",neutral
"00:03:55,770","00:04:02,610","This is why in Russia, for example, right now you would still see a Vladimir Lenin statue essentially on every main square of every city, which is kind of strange, right?",surprise
"00:04:02,610","00:04:04,368",But they didn't even bury the guy still.,sadness
"00:04:04,370","00:04:07,129","So, you know, what else could you expect right now?",neutral
"00:04:07,129","00:04:10,169","Look, Poland is great and all, and as a Russian, I really enjoyed being there.",happiness
"00:04:10,169","00:04:15,169",But I actually did run into a bit of an issue when I was in Poland trying to edit my YouTube videos.,fear
"00:04:15,250","00:04:21,629","Since I'm from Russia and I talk about it all the time, I often have to go on Russian social media and Russian websites to get my information.",neutral
"00:04:21,869","00:04:26,588","And in Poland, pretty much every single Russian website that I tried to visit was completely blocked.",anger

"00:06:36,550","00:06:41,310","One very, very big difference that I do notice here in Poland, is that it's actually the balconies.",surprise
"00:06:41,310","00:06:48,970","And in particular, what I'm talking about is the fact that the balconies in Russia, essentially, it gets very cold in the winter.",neutral

"00:06:51,930","00:07:00,290","And, you know, the balconies that we have in these buildings, they're pretty much similar, but here, people do not, like, add additional stuff on them to make it, you know, warmer in the winter, basically.",neutral
"00:07:00,290","00:07:11,610","In Russia, pretty much everybody, including my parents, for example, they have additional stuff on the balcony to make it warm in the winter so that you can actually go there in the winter and, like, store stuff there so that snow doesn't fall on it, basically.",neutral
"00:07:11,610","00:07:11,930",Right.,neutral
"00:07:11,930","00:07:16,930","But here in Poland, when you take a look at these old buildings, all the balconies come like stock, you know what I'm saying?",neutral
"00:07:16,930","00:07:19,110","They're not modified, which is pretty interesting.",happiness
"00:07:19,110","00:07:25,990","You know, as a Russian, I'm pretty used to the fact that, you know, balconies kind of have to be modified a little bit to accommodate for the cold weather and everything.",neutral
"00:07:25,990","00:07:32,310","But here in Poland, I guess it's probably forbidden, so you have to kind of keep it as it is to keep the old architectural style or something.",neutral
"00:07:32,310","00:07:40,350","So it's kind of funny that, you know, here in Poland, they take this kind of architectural legacy of the Soviet Union, you could say, more seriously than they do in Russia.",surprise
"00:07:40,350","00:07:47,589","But that does come at a cost to the fact that in the winter, there is going to be snow on your balcony, it is going to be cold, but otherwise, it feels very, very similar.",sadness
