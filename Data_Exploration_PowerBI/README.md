# Data Exploration and Fundamentals of AI – SDG 6 Project

## Overview
This project was completed during **Year 1, Block A**.
It introduced the fundamentals of programming, statistics, and data storytelling through a research-driven approach.  

For this project, I explored **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation**, focusing on the topic:  
> **“The correlation between access to clean water sources and the prevalence of water-related conflicts.”**

The goal was to analyze and visualize real-world data to uncover patterns and insights related to the social and environmental challenges of water accessibility.

## Objectives
- Investigate global data related to **clean water access** and **water-related conflicts**.  
- Explore the relationship between environmental factors and human well-being through data analysis.  
- Build an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to visualize and communicate findings.  
- Practice **data cleaning**, **statistical analysis**, and **visual storytelling**.  
- Reflect on the **ethical and societal dimensions** of AI and data science for sustainable development.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Sourced open datasets from organizations such as the **World Bank**, **UNESCO**, and **Our World in Data**.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Processed the data in **Python** using Pandas and NumPy to ensure quality and consistency.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends and correlations using statistical summaries and visualizations.  
4. **Dashboard Design:** Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** to present relationships between clean water access, population, and conflict prevalence.

## Key Features
- Cleaned and prepared international datasets on **water access** and **conflict frequency**.  
- Designed a **Power BI dashboard** visualizing geographic and temporal patterns.  
- Highlighted potential correlations between **clean water access** and **conflict intensity**.  
- Combined analytical and narrative techniques to communicate insights effectively.  

---

## Results
- Found that regions with **limited access to clean water** often experience higher rates of **resource-driven tensions**.  
- Demonstrated how data visualization can support awareness of **global sustainability issues**.  
- Produced a functional **Power BI dashboard** showcasing dynamic, data-driven storytelling.
