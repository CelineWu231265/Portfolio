# Emotion Classification with Natural Language Processing

## Overview
This project was completed during **Year 2, Block C**, focusing on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for the Content Intelligence Agency (CIA).  
The goal was to design and evaluate models that classify **emotions in Spanish dialogue transcripts** from the TV show *La Isla de las Tentaciones*.

The project explored **traditional ML approaches**, **transformers**, and **zero-shot classification** while considering **explainability and bias**.

---

## Objectives
- Preprocess and annotate Spanish text data for emotion classification.  
- Train multiple models and compare their accuracy and generalization.  
- Implement **transformer-based zero-shot learning** with prompt engineering.  
- Investigate model bias and interpretability using XAI techniques.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Transformers (Hugging Face), scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SHAP  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, Visual Studio Code  

---

## Key Features
- Multilingual NLP pipeline with preprocessing and translation  
- Model comparison: logistic regression, naive Bayes, BERT-based transformers  
- Explainability using SHAP and attention visualization  
- Bias detection and mitigation analysis

---

## Results
- Created a labeled dataset of Spanish emotion transcripts.  
- Achieved improved model accuracy through fine-tuning and prompt optimization.  
- Gained insights into language bias and model interpretability.

## Reflections
This project improved my understanding of **multilingual NLP**, **transformer models**, and **ethical AI practices**.  
It was also my first time working deeply with **XAI** tools and real-world linguistic data.
